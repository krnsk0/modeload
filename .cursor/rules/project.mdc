See [custom-modes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/custom-modes.mdc) for info on where cursor stores custom modes in its DB

Our goal is to create a VERY SIMPLE tool that can:
1. allow saving custom modes to disk at a specified location, e.g. `modeload save modes.json`
2. allow loading modes from a specified location e.g. `modeload load modes.json`

Requirements:
- we should back up the DB before the load command

Stack:
- use TSUP
- need to ensure user has sqlite3
